# Double posets and the antipode of QSym

This is a preprint currently undergoing revision (it is polished already, but I am still trying to extend its results).

Up-to-date PDF files can be downloaded from my website:

- [Standard version](http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/algebra/dp-abstr.pdf).

- [Detailed version](http://www.cip.ifi.lmu.de/~grinberg/algebra/dp-abstr-long.pdf).

The preprint also appears on the arXiv as [arXiv:1509.08355](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08355), but is less frequently updated there.
